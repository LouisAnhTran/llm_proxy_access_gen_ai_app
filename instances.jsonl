This project involved collaboration and mentorship from SUTD SDS, Gebirah, and Google Cloud Singapore. He developed a scalable and functional software solution using various software methodologies and processes in compliance with industry standards, including BDD (Behavior Driven Development), TDD (Test Driven Development), Agile methodology, SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), Microservices, SaaS (Software as a Service), MVC design pattern, and Restful API. Additionally, responsibilities included system architecture design, database design, class diagram design, MVC pattern design, Restful API design, and hierarchical resource design for effective routing. Louis integrated AI/ML features using Google Vertex, Google NLP, Google Cloud Storage, and OpenAI technologies. Successfully deployed the application on the Google Cloud platform. Conducted rigorous unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing using Rspec, Capybara, Minitest, and Cucumber.\n\nProject name: Android Mobile Application | Roles: Project Manager, Technical Lead, and Full Stack Developer\n\nLouis led a team of seven software developers in creating a functional Android Mobile Application as part of the Smart Nation initiative. The goal was to streamline and simplify group project management for university students using Java, Android Studio, Google Firebase database, and Authentication. He took charge of system architecture, Firebase NoSQL database design, class diagram design, design patterns, as well as coding the core functionalities of the application. Implementing the Factory Design pattern, Louis enhanced the codebase structure and data management efficiency. He applied Java's advanced features and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, etc., both correctly and creatively to develop the application.\n\n\nLegal Case Information Retrieval & Search Engine \u2013 CS3245 \n\nLouis led a team of 3 software developers to design and implement a robust, scalable, and efficient search engine from scratch in collaboration with Intellex, a company partially originating from NUS. The aim was to execute Free text and Boolean information retrieval queries on Legal cases provided by Intellex.\n\nThey implemented a scalable and robust indexing construction using a Single-pass in-memory indexing algorithm, Python's low-level functions for memory management and hard-disk data transmission, compression techniques for efficient space complexity, and skip pointer algorithms to enhance the speed of the search process.\n\nThe team constructed a robust search engine for efficient data retrieval from the hard disk, employing a combination of data structures including LinkedList, Queue, Stack, Hashtable, along with parsing of complex Boolean queries using the Shunting-yard algorithm."}]}

During this time:\n\n- He developed an LLM Proxy server to efficiently handle a large number of concurrent inference requests for both SAP\u2019s self-hosted and open-source LLM models. Louis utilized Python and the FastAPI web framework for this purpose, ensuring robust asynchronous handling support. Additionally, he was responsible for the development, testing, and deployment of the LLM Proxy server on various platforms, including the local machine, Docker virtualized environment, and SAP's Kubernetes development cluster. The deployment process involved using Docker, Docker Network, Volume, Kubernetes, and Istio Virtual Services.\n\n- Louis conducted performance tests for LLM proxy servers created with Flask and FastAPI frameworks in both local environments and Kubernetes clusters. He utilized tools such as Postman and Port-forwarding for these tests. Furthermore, he developed and deployed a Python application into SAP's development Kubernetes cluster, simulating Postman functionality and conducting robust LLM proxy performance tests. This process required leveraging Istio Virtual Services for complex traffic routing, in addition to support from Asyncio and Aiohttp packages.\n\n- He implemented integration tests for SAP's AI Core and Runtime Adapter, aimed at testing the Container-as-a-Service feature for expired token scenarios. Louis also enabled LLM proxy tests with AI Core hosted models in the PR cluster using a mock LLM server.\n\n- Louis developed and deployed a mock server that mimicked LLM models with both non-streaming and streaming support. This served to facilitate development and performance testing processes. He collaborated with the GitOps repository and ArgoCD application to ensure seamless synchronization of the mock server from the code base to the Kubernetes cluster.\n\n- He implemented the proof of concept for the LiteLLM library by developing a clone of the AI Core LLM proxy using the LiteLLM library with streaming support. This included an advanced fallback mechanism for Circuit Breaker as well as a mock model for testing. Louis conducted tests in the Docker environment and deployed them to the Kubernetes cluster."}]}
